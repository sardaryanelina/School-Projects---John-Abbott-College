# Pet Store Management System
## Description


This is the source code of the Pet Store Management System project that was created for the purpose of the Visual Basic .Net and C# class' final project, with professor [Gregory Prokopski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prokopski/) ðŸ”—.

This course introduced students to the VisualStudio.Net, Visual Basic.Net and C# .Net Integrated Development Environments. The emphasis of this course was placed on clear software design, on advanced use and creation of Classes as well as Graphical User Interfaces design. We explored Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) GUI, in order to create rich, interactive client applications. This course improved my knowledge of industry level software design. Using the .Net Framework, my team and I were able to create and deploy fully functional, accessible, and secure Windows applications ðŸ“š.

The next step to this project would've been to add an executable file to it in order to download it on Windows operating systems.
